			You're live! Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at `&lt;your blog URL&gt;/ghost/`. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!<br/>
			<br/>
			## Getting Started<br/>
			<br/>
			Ghost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!<br/>
			<br/>
			Writing in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:<br/>
			<br/>
			* Item number one<br/>
			* Item number two<br/>
			    * A nested item<br/>
			* A final item<br/>
			<br/>
			or with numbers!<br/>

			1. Remember to buy some milk<br/>
			2. Drink the milk<br/>
			3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it<br/>
			<br/>
			### Links<br/>
			<br/>
			Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in url, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.<br/>
			<br/>
			### What about Images?<br/>
			<br/>
			Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:<br/>
			<br/>
			![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)<br/>
			<br/>
			Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:<br/>
			<br/>
			![A bowl of bananas]<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			### Quoting<br/>
			<br/>
			Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.<br/>

			&gt; Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.<br/>
			<br/>
			### Working with Code<br/>
			<br/>
			Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `&lt;code&gt;` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.<br/>
			<br/>
			    .awesome-thing {<br/>
			        display: block;<br/>
			        width: 100%;<br/>
			    }<br/>
			<br/>
			### Ready for a Break? <br/>
			<br/>
			Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.<br/>
			<br/>
			---<br/>
			<br/>
			### Advanced Usage<br/>
			<br/>
			There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can  write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.<br/>
			<br/>
			&lt;input type="text" placeholder="I'm an input field!" /&gt;<br/>
			<br/>
			That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)<br/>
